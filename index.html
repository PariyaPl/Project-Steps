          <h2>Data</h2>
          <p>The first step of doing every data related project is declaring your data. This includes explaining where the data has came from and how this data was prossecd do be usefull for this project.
            The data you work with can come from different sources. For example if you're working on a project related to the applications of Machine Learning in mechanical systems, the data you need is obtained during multiple experiments. 
            Of course these experiments might be done through a simulation; but it's always important to consider the required accuracy of the data when choosing the method to obtain it.

        <section id="Methods">
          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>After procissing the data you need to choose your methods for using this data. To choose the method several things have to be taken into consideration.
            One important thing to consider is the type of data the project is working with. Different methods might not have the same accuracy when applied to different types of data.
            Another thing to consider is how big the dataset is. This is important because the dataset can mislead the model if it isn't big enough due to how big a dataset the model needs for training all it's parameters. 
            One more thing to consider while choosing a method is the methods others have already used for similar project. This requires reading a good number of papers!

        <section id="Results">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The next step is going through the results of your methods on your data. This can include calculating the accuracy of the method for train and test data.
            Another thing that can be good for understanding how good the method is working, is comparing it with similar works that other people have done in similar projects.
